<p>This privacy policy applies to all information collected or submitted to our websites.<br />
Collecting Personal Information<br />
We receive and may store information you provide to our websites. This information may include:</p>
<p>* Name, age, address, telephone number, email address<br />
* Credit card number or bank card number<br />
* Purchase information and history</p>
<p>Safeway collects personal information in the course of providing retail goods and services, program memberships, promotions, surveys or sweepstakes offers. We may collect other personal information you provide us, including information about other people, such as the name and address of a gift recipient or reference. By providing us with solicited or unsolicited personal information, you consent to our using such information, subject to applicable laws and the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Using Personal Information</strong><br />
We may use personal information to confirm your orders, deliver products and services that you purchase or request, register you as a user of our web site(s), prevent criminal activity on your account, bill you for your purchases, conduct market research via surveys sent to you, respond to your inquiries, or verify and ship a contest prize.<br />
Safeway Club Card information and other information may be used to help make Safeway&#8217;s products, services and programs more useful to its customers. Additionally, Safeway may use personal information to provide you with newsletters, articles, product or service alerts, new product or service announcements, saving awards, event invitations, personally tailored coupons, program and promotional information and offers, and other information, which may be provided to Safeway by other companies. If you prefer not to receive this type of information from us, you can contact us at 1-877-723-3929 or online, click here.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Data and Cookies</strong><br />
We aggregate information through cookies, or alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer&#8217;s hard drive through the web browser. This allows us to automatically collect your computer&#8217;s network address and operating system, the site from which you linked to our site, the time and date of your visit, how you use one of our services and what products you purchase. This helps us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience and store items in your cart between visits. It also allows us to aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information that do not include personal information and provide this information to our partners and service providers. By doing so, we hope to understand our customers&#8217; needs so that we can provide them with new products and services or tailor existing products and services to fit their needs</p>
<p><strong>Disclosing Personal Information</strong><br />
When processing your information, we may disclose personal information to our related companies and third parties for purposes outlined in this privacy policy. We do not sell, rent, lease, share or disclose personal information to any non-related companies or third parties without your prior consent, except for the following purposes:</p>
<p>* Filling Orders. We may provide personal information to a third party to fill your order. For example, if you purchase a product or service using a credit or debit card, your card number and transaction information will be shared with the payment processor or card issuer. In order to ship your product, we will provide your shipping information to the carrier.<br />
* Business Purposes. We may provide personal information to our partners and suppliers for customer support services and processing of personal information on behalf of Safeway. We may also share personal information with our affiliate companies, or in the course of an actual or potential sale, re-organization, consolidation, merger or amalgamation of our business or businesses.<br />
* Other Purposes. We may disclose personal information as required by law; such as in response to a subpoena, court order or a specific request by a law enforcement agency or as otherwise required by law. We may also disclose personal information to third parties investigating potential fraud or questionable activities regarding your account or the use of our services.</p>
<p>You may agree to provide your personal information separately to third parties that provide products, services or content to Safeway. If you do so, your personal information will be subject to those third party privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing Your Personal Information</strong><br />
We update your personal information as required. We will be able to serve you best, however, if you provide us with notification of any changes. If you find errors, you can request that changes be made. We may be prevented from allowing you to have access to some information, in which case you will be so advised. You can update your information via our website, or you may submit a written request for changes to any customer service representative at a Safeway store.</p>
<p>We retain your personal information only for as long as reasonably required. The length of time information is retained depends upon the purpose for which the information was collected</p>
<p><strong>Safeguarding Personal Information</strong><br />
The fact that you have trusted Safeway with your personal information is important to us and we take steps to maintain its security. We have appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place to protect and secure the information we collect. To safeguard against unauthorized access, you are required to login to certain secure areas of our web site using a user name and a password. Both user name and password are encrypted when sent over the Internet. If you are unable to provide the correct password, you will not be able to access these areas.<br />
<strong><br />
Links to and from Other Web Sites</strong><br />
Our websites may offer links to other third party web sites for your convenience and information only. These web sites have their own privacy and information collection practices and security measures.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription Refills</strong><br />
When you use our online prescription refill service, you provide us with your prescription so that we can process your refill request. We understand the confidential nature of such information. Your prescription number is treated as protected information as described in our Pharmacy Privacy Policy. All other information you provide when you use the online prescription refill service is treated as otherwise described in this privacy policy</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong><br />
Safeway does not knowingly collect personal information from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. If a minor (as defined by law) provides us with his/her personal information without parental or guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Safeway marketing communications.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br />
You always have a choice as to whether you provide us with personal information. By using our website or accepting certain services offered at our retail outlets, you consent to our use of personal information that is collected or submitted as described in this privacy policy. Withholding certain information, however, may prevent us from providing you with products and services. For instance, withholding a name will prevent us from processing your order online. Withholding a government issued identification card will prevent us from selling you tobacco or alcohol products or prescriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Updates to Privacy Policy</strong><br />
We may add, modify or remove portions of our privacy policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically. If you have previously accepted one of our special offers or agreements, those applicable terms and your continued use will apply to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the case of a conflict, however, this privacy policy supersedes those prior policies or agreements. If our practice in using and/or sharing personal information changes in the future, those changes will be reflected in this privacy policy. You can determine the date this privacy policy was last updated by referring to the modification date found at the bottom of this privacy policy.</p>
